# An introduction to data analysis in Python

The material here is a compilation of concepts, practices, and tools that I've found useful for doing data analysis in Python. Most of it relates to writing code but some is about basic project structure and tools. While Python is a flexible and powerful open-source programming language, data analysis can be difficult to do with only the built-in functions. Many of the tools I'll cover here are packages that provide additional functionality for numeric computation, data import/export, data manipulation, and visualization.

## Getting started
Excel is easy because it only requires double-clicking on a file to open it and start working. We have to do some more work to get started working in Python but it will be worth the extra effort.

### Install Anaconda Python distribution
If you haven't already done so, [download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.6][1]. Anaconda provides a base installation with most packages needed for data analysis and a few extra useful tools. If you don't already have a preferred text editor you can use Spyder, which comes with the Anaconda installation.
