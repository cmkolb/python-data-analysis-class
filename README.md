# An introduction to data analysis in Python

The material here is a compilation of concepts, practices, and tools that I've found useful for doing data analysis in Python. Most of it relates to writing code but some is about basic project structure and tools.

Many of the tools I'll cover here are packages that provide additional functionality for numeric computation, data import/export, data manipulation, and visualization.
